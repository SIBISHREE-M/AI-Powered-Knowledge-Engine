AI-Powered Knowledge Engine for Smart Support & Ticket Resolution

This project, AI-Powered Knowledge Engine for Smart Support & Ticket Resolution, is designed to enhance the efficiency and quality of customer support systems using artificial intelligence. The main goal of this system is to automatically understand, categorize, and respond to customer support tickets, reducing response time and improving resolution accuracy. The backend leverages machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) to classify tickets based on their content, determine their priority, and suggest solutions from a knowledge base. The frontend provides a user-friendly interface for support agents to view tickets, track their status, and access AI-generated recommendations. Key features of the project include:

Automatic Ticket Classification: The system classifies incoming support tickets into categories for faster processing.

AI-Powered Knowledge Engine: Provides suggested solutions to tickets based on historical data and knowledge base entries.

Prioritization of Tickets: Assigns priority levels to tickets to ensure critical issues are addressed promptly.

Scalable and Modular Design: Both backend and frontend are designed to handle multiple ticket types and concurrent users efficiently.

Integration Ready: Can be integrated with existing support platforms to enhance operational workflows.

The project structure includes a backend folder containing APIs and ML models, a frontend folder for the user interface, and supporting files such as .gitignore, LICENSE, and this README.md. The system is built to be easily installable with a virtual environment, with dependencies listed in requirements.txt. Running the backend server enables ticket processing and AI recommendations, while the frontend allows agents to interact with the system seamlessly.
